Captcp
======

About
-----

Since several years I used to use a own repository of scripts to analyze
network traffic. First I started with plain tcpdump, tcptrace, tcpslice,
tcpstat and the other tools. After some years I started to wrote an own set of
scripts, starting with Perl and later also some Ruby scripts. Before I forget,
of course, a few C programs are also in the collection. Captcp is the attempt
to rewrite the scripts in Python.

This documentation is also avaiable in PDF form: link:captcp.pdf[PDF file]


Some Words About Packet Analysis
--------------------------------

During the years some wisdoms are here collected. You can ignore them, sure,
but eventually there are some tricks for you.

* Don't capture data life - capture the data via tcpdump and analyze the data off-line
* If you know what you want to analyze you can adjust tcpdump to capture the required data
* Make backups of your traces
* Don't use one tool, find the most useful tool for your requirements
* Last but not least: question the results!

Modulse Overview
----------------

The script functionality is splitted into submodules. Similar to git, perf and
kvm-tool. The following list provides an overview over the currently supported
list. If in doubt you can call captcp without any argument to get the full
list.

- Stacktrace
- Show
- Statistic
- Payloadtimeport
- Timesequence
- Geoip
- Throughtput
- Connection
- Template
- Sequencegraph
