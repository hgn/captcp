Stacktrace
----------


Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
[verse]
'captcp' stacktrace
	--output-dir <dir> [--init]
	[--verbose <debug | info | warning | error >]

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
Record Linux Network stack internal variables for analysis. Per
default the initial congestion window as well as the slow start threshold
(ssthresh) are recorded.

Note that root capabilities are required to run this analysis. If the script
is not started as root then the script try to spawn systemtap via
captcplink:sudo[1]. So you can edit /etc/sudoers via visudo to execute
systemtap with increased permissions.

Background
~~~~~~~~~~

This module use captcplink:systemap[1] in the background to collect internal
Kernel data. So make sure you have installed systemtap and have a runnig
systemtap environment. Please check this before you use this module.

If an error is encountered then often ther Kernelsource differs from the
actual running Kernelversion.

Options
~~~~~~~

-o::
--output-dir::
				Specify the outpur directory where all files are generated. This
				can be "." - the actual directory. This option is required to make
				sure that the amount of generated files do not fill the current
				directory.

-i::
--init::
				Generate template files for Gnuplot and Makefile. In other words:
				without these option only the raw-data files are generated.
				You are free to specify this option every time. But note that the
				original file is overwriten each time - without any warning! Don't
				use this option if the Gnuplot or/and Makefile is modified.
